# wiki-vis-his

stands for wikipedia.org visits history

A browser extension/addon which tracks your wikipedia.org article visits

### Version 1.0

**for development:**

* npm 7 or 6 is needed
* webpack

**run it locally**

1. `npx webpack`
2. load the Addon in your Firefox

I started this extension for myself as a way to see which Wikipedia article I'm visiting. This should help me to improve
my learning process where I see which Wikipedia articles I'm reading regulary. I think it is helpfull for everybody to
know about its Wikipedia visits :)
Additionally you can see when you are looking to donate for Wikipedia, how often did you opened a Wikipedia page.

It is started as an Mozilla Firefox Addon but and will be also available as a Chrome extension, hopefully soon.

This is my first JS/Browser Extension project. Don't hesitate to show me, if I can improve something.

Pull/Merge Request are also welcome. Please take a look into issues.

Thanks to https://github.com/tlemens. He helped me alot to make it possible.
